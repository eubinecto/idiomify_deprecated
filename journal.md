Started developing.


There are three main tasks at stake:

1. prepare the training data
2. train the model
3. optimize the model


> What data do I need?

First of all, you must have a dictionary of idioms, with well-defined definitions.

Time to go back to merge-idioms. 
1. change the name of the project to identify-idioms, first.
2. find some ways to extract and parse as many idioms as possible, with their definitions.

I'm not scraping idiom2collocations altogether, no.

I'll do that, AND do idiomify.

The goal is to:
1. output a list of idioms that best describe an input phrase.
2. with extracted collocations to pick the one that they really wanted.
