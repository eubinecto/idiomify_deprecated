Started developing.


There are three main tasks at stake:

1. prepare the training data
2. train the model
3. optimize the model


> What data do I need?

First of all, you must have a dictionary of idioms, with well-defined definitions.

Time to go back to merge-idioms. 
1. change the name of the project to identify-idioms, first.
2. find some ways to extract and parse as many idioms as possible, with their definitions.
